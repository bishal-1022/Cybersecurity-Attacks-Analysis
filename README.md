# Cyber Security Attacks Analysis

## Description

The Cybersecurity Attacks Analysis project provides a comprehensive exploration of a dataset containing 25 varied metrics and 40,000 records related to cybersecurity attacks. This project is intended to assist cybersecurity professionals, researchers, and analysts in understanding trends and patterns within the domain of cybersecurity.

## Overview

The Cybersecurity Attacks Analysis project provides a comprehensive exploration of cybersecurity attack data, offering insights into attack patterns, severity levels, and distributions based on various metrics. This project is aimed at cybersecurity professionals, researchers, and enthusiasts seeking to analyze and understand the dynamics of cyber threats.

## Dataset

The dataset includes a wide range of metrics such as timestamp, source IP address, destination IP address, source port, destination port, protocol, packet length, packet type, traffic type, payload data, malware indicators, anomaly scores, alerts/warnings, attack type, attack signature, action taken, severity level, user information, device information, network segment, geo-location data, proxy information, firewall logs, IDS/IPS alerts, and log source.

## Features

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Gain insights into the dataset through summary statistics, unique values, and missing value checks.
- **Visualizations:** Utilize matplotlib and seaborn to create informative visualizations, including statewise attack distributions, severity level distributions, and more.
- **Customization:** Easily adapt the provided code to your specific dataset structure and analysis goals.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/cybersecurity-attacks-analysis.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

### EDA

- The exploratory data analysis involves understanding the context of each column and identifying unique values in each metric.
- Summary statistics and checks for missing values are performed.

### Visualizations

- Distribution of attack types: A bar chart depicting the distribution of different attack types.
- Severity level distribution: A bar chart showcasing the distribution of severity levels of cybersecurity attacks.
- Correlation heatmap: A heatmap illustrating the correlation between different metrics.
- Malware indicators vs. anomaly scores: A scatter plot to explore the relationship between malware indicators and anomaly scores.

### Statewise Analysis

- Statewise distribution of attacks: A bar chart displaying the distribution of attacks across different states or regions.
- Statewise severity level distribution: A bar chart showcasing the severity level distribution in different states or regions.
- Statewise attack type distribution: A bar chart depicting the distribution of attack types across states or regions.
